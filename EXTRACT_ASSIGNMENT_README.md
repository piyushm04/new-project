# 📋 How to Extract Assignment Content

I've created 2 methods to extract the assignment content. Choose the one that's easiest for you:

## Method 1: Browser Console Script (EASIEST - Recommended) ⭐

**Steps:**
1. Open the assignment page in your browser (https://learning.ccbp.in/...)
2. Press **F12** (or Right-click → Inspect) to open Developer Tools
3. Click on the **"Console"** tab
4. Open the file `extract_assignment.js` in a text editor
5. **Copy the entire content** of `extract_assignment.js`
6. **Paste it into the browser console**
7. Press **Enter**
8. The assignment text will be:
   - Displayed in the console
   - **Automatically copied to your clipboard**
9. Come back here and paste the content!

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works instantly
- ✅ No file saving needed
- ✅ Automatically copies to clipboard
- ✅ Works on any browser

## Method 2: Python Script (Alternative)

**Steps:**
1. On the assignment page, press **Ctrl+S** (or File → Save As)
2. Save the page as **`assignment_page.html`** in this folder
3. Install BeautifulSoup (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python extract_assignment.py
   ```
5. The content will be saved to `assignment_content.txt`
6. Open `assignment_content.txt` and copy its contents
7. Paste it here!

## Method 3: Manual Copy-Paste (Simplest if page is short)

If the assignment is not too long, you can simply:
1. Select all the assignment text on the page (Ctrl+A)
2. Copy it (Ctrl+C)
3. Paste it here (Ctrl+V)

## Which Method Should I Use?

- **Method 1** (Browser Console) - Best for most cases ⭐
- **Method 2** (Python Script) - Good if you prefer automation
